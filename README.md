## My process 💻✒

### Built with 🧱🛠

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned 📚

I'm very proud of the result of the challenge and especially with the ability to create mockups from scratch. Furthermore, I tried to make the cell phone interactively as if it were a prototype of the product.

### Continued development 🚀

Currently I have just achieved my first goal of finishing all the HTML and CSS challenges from the frontend mentor, and with that I am free to start studying JavaScript 😁, I'm so excited.
